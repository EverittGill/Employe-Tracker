# Employee Tracker

## Description

It's a basic command line program that helps you keep track of your staff using SQL tables in a database.

- I was motivated to make this because I was losing track of who worked for who and how much I needed to pay my staff
- I built this project to fulfill my motivation.
- This program allows me to keep track of my staff a little bit better.
- From making this I learned about linking sql tables and integrating inquirer with sql.


## Installation

To install this program just copy the code. That's all you have to do for this one until you want to run it

## Usage
